There are two files: pygametictactoe.py and tictactoe.py

pygametictactoe.py uses the logic of tictactoe.py along with pygame to create a GUI.

In the game, user (X) plays versus AI (O) and the score is recorded.

The user may press "restart" to reset the board as well as the scores, or "play again" to reset only the board and keep the score.

There is also a "quit" option.

Below is the displayed output for all three cases (win, lose, draw):

WIN:
